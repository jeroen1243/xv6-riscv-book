This edition of the book has been converted to LaTeX.
In order to build it, ensure you have a TeX distribution that contains
the `pdflatex` command. With that, you should be able to build the book
by running `make`, which will clone the OS itself and build the book
to `book.pdf` in the main directory.

Figures are drawn using `inkscape`.
